## Installation

### Nextcloud 25 and newer

The app is [shipped](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/developer_manual/app_publishing_maintenance/release_process.html#shipped-apps) and comes with the installation of Nextcloud Server. No additional steps are necessary.

### Nextcloud 24 and older

The app is available through the [app store](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/twofactor_totp). It can be [installed through Nextcloud's app management UI](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/apps_management.html#managing-apps).

## Enabling TOTP 2FA for your account

## Setting options for security hardening

The secret generated by this application is 32 characters long and includes only the characters A-Z and the numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 ([RFC 4648 Base32 alphabet](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-6)), meeting the recommended 160-bit depth by [RFC 4226](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4226#section-4).
Every 30 seconds, a 6-character numeric one-time password (OTP) is generated using the SHA-1 hash algorithm on both - the server and the TOTP authenticator app on your smartphone /-device. So whoever has the secret can get access to the second factor. That's why TOTP apps are usually very well secured, at least with a master password or passphrase. 
Since the OTP only grants access if exactly the same hash algorithm and the same token length are set on the server as the TOTP authenticator app, there is the possibility to change these values by the user. In the vast majority of cases, these options are not needed to be touched at all. They are only intended for cases with extremely high security requirements and not supported by every TOTP smartphone app.

### Configurable Options

- **Secret Length:**
    * Default: 32 characters (160 bits)
    * Minimum: 26 characters (130 bits)
    * Maximum: 128 characters (640 bits)

    The admin can adjust the secret length using

    ```sh
    occ config:app:set --value=64 -- twofactor_totp secret_length
    ```

### Considerations
* The secret length affects only the initial generation of secrets for users. Once generated, secrets are encrypted and stored in the database and unencrypted stored in the TOTP app/device. Changing the secret length afterwards does not affect previously generated secrets.

* Similarly, token length and hash algorithm can be changed at any time by the user. However, these changes must be exactly the same in the used TOTP smartphone app.

* Note that not all TOTP apps support multiple token lengths or hash algorithms. The Aegis app, however, supports all configurations mentioned here.

## Login with external apps
Once you enable OTP with Two Factor Totp, your aplications (for example your Android app or your GNOME app) will need to login using device passwords. To manage it, [know more here](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/stable/user_manual/en/session_management.html#managing-devices)

## Development setup

* `composer i`
* `npm ci`
* `npm run build` or `npm run dev` [more info](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/developer_manual/digging_deeper/npm.html)
